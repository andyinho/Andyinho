<h2>👋 Hello, I'm Andres!</h2>

<p>
I’m a Healthcare Software Engineer building full-stack web applications focused on patient onboarding, intake workflows, and compliance-aware systems. I design and implement frontend and backend solutions that support reliable, high-volume user interactions and complex, form-heavy workflows.
</p>

<p>
My work includes building asynchronous processing pipelines, background jobs, caching strategies, and queue-based workflows to improve performance and system resilience. I prioritize clean architecture, data integrity, and observability when shipping software in high-risk healthcare environments.
</p>

<h2>🌍 Beyond the Code</h2>

<p>
Outside of engineering, I enjoy traveling and exploring new environments. I’ve visited 13 countries and counting, from major cities and remote deserts to the Arctic Circle.
</p>

<p>
I’m especially interested in experiencing places through local food, culture, and everyday activities.
</p>

<p>
I also enjoy soccer and backpacking as ways to unwind and spend time away from a screen. Both help me maintain balance and perspective outside of work.
